Evently is composed of three microservices.
The events manager, a notifier, and the front end.

The front is made with angular and the other two microservices with Golang.

This website is created with Hugo. And more specific with the template DOCSY.
Check the [Docsy User Guide](https://docsy.dev/docs/), which lives in the [Docsy theme repo](https://github.com/google/docsy/tree/master/userguide).

Overall the application, I try to make use of the dependency inversion principle as the same as other concepts from clean architecture like repositories, adapters, and use cases.
As the same as clean code concepts.
